Hello there and welcome to my Data Portfolio "curiosity"

You must be asking yourself why is it named curiosity.

Oxford Dictionary defines curiosity as

noun
1. a strong desire to know of learn something.
2. an unusual or interesting object or fact


This is a container for projects which I have been motivated to learn about, and I endeavour to help you walk away having gleaned at least one unusual or interesting fact.

Please feel welcome to ask any questions about the projects in this repository.

Contrary to popular belief curiosity did not kill the cat. It killed static ways of thinking.
